Android Demo for students

Build updates (Monday, 18:00)
Added additional activity showing details of movie selected
Movie is now shown in a table
You are expected to add more details to the table and to style it



Build Updates (Sunday, 14:00)
The original json feed has been reduced to 10 movies for speed of loading

A progress dialog has been added to illustrate code being loaded

Note ListView is being populated in the onPostExecute

This may not work on an emulator - you probably need a device

All Log messages start with Movie so you can filter the result

Clicking on List will show a toast with the title of the movie
